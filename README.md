# Bloccit

A Reddit-style application to demonstrate foundation programming and web development skills.

Made with my mentor, Aaron, at Bloc (http://bloc.io)

Restyled with the Bootswatch Amelia theme for Bootstrap. 

## Setup

Copy the "config/application.example.yml" file and remove "example". Your application.yml should contain your sensitive credentials. It should be included in .gitnore as well.
