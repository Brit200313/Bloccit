# Bloccit

A Reddit-style application to demonstrate foundation programming and web development skills using Ruby on Rails. 

Made with my mentor, Aaron, at [Bloc](http://bloc.io). 

Restyled with the [Bootswatch Amelia theme](http://bootswatch.com/amelia/) for Bootstrap. 

## Setup

Copy the "config/application.example.yml" file and remove "example". Your application.yml should contain your sensitive credentials. It should be included in .gitnore as well. 

## Deployment

I recommend deploying Bloccit on to [Ninefold](www.ninefold.com) for easy Rails deployment.

## Tested with Magnum CI 

Magnum PI would be proud with how these tests are passing!
